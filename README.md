**SurgiSim VR: An Immersive AR-Enhanced Surgical Training Platform**

Developing a comprehensive Virtual Reality (VR)/ Alternate Reality surgical training application within a 1.5-month timeframe. This program is designed to work through a two module method where the first module utilizes a virtual reality system designed to test the user on classifying basic tools, procedures, and other surgical basics using a classification Machine Learning Model. The second module will utilize both AR and VR, in order to have a virtual surgical room for learning the basic surgical procedures, as well as an AR version if the required surgical tools are available for use. A scoring model will be used for questions to help users study the basic elements in the model to help students get questions tailored to their current level of knowledge.

**Module 1: Introduction to Surgical Tools**

_Objective:_ Acquaint students with various surgical instruments, their functions, and proper handling techniques.

_Features:_

*   **3D Interactive Tool Library:** Provides detailed 3D models of surgical instruments, allowing students to explore and understand each tool's components and uses.
    
*   **Machine Learning Model Usage:** Utilize a classification model trained on the 3D models in order to successfully classify and recognize user’s choices as correct or incorrect.
    
*   **Gamified Learning Experience:** Incorporates quizzes and interactive challenges that reward students for correctly identifying instruments and demonstrating proper usage, enhancing engagement and retention.
    

**Module 2: Simulated Surgical Procedures**

_Objective:_ Allow users to practice surgical techniques and methods in either a virtual reality room or assisted reality if available. 

_Features:_

*   **VR Surgical Simulations:** Enables students to engage in realistic surgical procedures within a virtual operating room, practicing essential skills such as incisions and suturing.
    
*   **AR-Assisted Guidance:** Provides step-by-step procedural guides overlaid onto the student's field of view during practice sessions, assisting in real-time decision-making and technique refinement.
    
*   **Generative AI Support:** Provide assistance to users if requested, can give background information and assistance on how to finish some tasks in the module in order to successfully accomplish any task the user has.
    

**Development Timeline and Tasks**

To achieve deployment within 1.5 months, the development process will be divided into focused phases:

*   **Week 1: Planning and Design**
    
    *   _Needs Assessment:_ Collaborate with medical educators to identify essential surgical procedures and tools for inclusion.
        
    *   _Technical Specifications:_ Define hardware and software requirements, focusing on readily available VR and AR platforms.
        
    *   _Storyboard Development:_ Outline user interactions, learning objectives, and scenario progression for both modules.
        
*   **Weeks 2-4: Development**
    
    *   _3D Modeling:_ Develop high-fidelity models of selected surgical instruments and anatomical structures.
        
    *   _Model Training:_ Training ML models on given requirements (tools, images, etc) ensuring a high accuracy rate for classifying successful and unsuccessful answers.
        
    *   _AR/VR Integration:_ Implement AR overlays for tool familiarization and VR environments for procedural simulations.
        
    *   _AI Integration:_ Develop the AI component to provide real-time feedback and adapt learning paths based on student performance.
        
    *   _Gamification Elements:_ Incorporate interactive challenges and reward systems to enhance engagement.
        
*   **Week 5: Testing and Refinement**
    
    *   _Internal Testing:_ Conduct evaluations to identify and resolve bugs or inaccuracies.
        
    *   _Beta Testing:_ Engage a small group of medical students and educators to provide feedback on usability and educational effectiveness. Give feedback via google form/other feedback form.
        
    *   _Iteration:_ Refine modules based on feedback, ensuring a user-friendly and pedagogically sound application.
        
*   **Week 6: Deployment and Training**
    
    *   _Implementation:_ Deploy the application in selected educational settings, ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure.
        
    *   _Instructor Training:_ Provide training sessions for educators to effectively integrate the application into their teaching methodologies.
        
    *   _Ongoing Support:_ Establish channels for technical support and gather user feedback for future updates.
        

**Equipment and Software Requirements**

*   **Hardware:**
    
    *   _VR Headsets:_ Utilize accessible devices such as Meta Quest 3 or HTC Vive Pro for immersive simulations.
